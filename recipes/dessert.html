        <p>You can ignore the ingredients listed on the cake mix instructions; eggs, Greek yogurt, instant pudding mix, 
            and water are all you need to make this confection. However, if you want an <strong>outrageously <em>moist</em> cake</strong>,
            you can whip in 3/4 cup vegetable oil as you beat in the other ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>For the Cake</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All-purpose flour, for flouring pans</li>
                    <li>1 package Devil's Food cake mix</li>
                    <li>1 (3.9-oz.) package instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
                    <li>1 c. plain Greek yogurt</li>
                    <li>4 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 c. water</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>For the Ganache Frosting</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pt. heavy cream</li>
                    <li>24 oz. semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease and flour the bottom and sides of two 8" round cake pans. Mix all of the cake 
                ingredients in a large bowl and divide batter evenly between the two pans.</li>
            <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with just a few crumbs attached (no gooey batter), 
                40 to 45 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the ganache: In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring the heavy cream to a simmer. Once you see tiny 
                bubbles form around the edges, remove from heat and add chocolate chips, whisking until combined. Let mixture chill 
                until it reaches a spreadable consistency, at least 30 minutes, before frosting cake.</li>
            <li>Top one round cake with ganache frosting, then place the second cake on top of it. Frost the top and sides of the cake, 
                and serve.</li>
        </ol>
